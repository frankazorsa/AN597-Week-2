#Challenge 1: Create a vector of 1 word character strings.
x <- "Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed."
x
#I used strsplit without space "" to divide all characters.
strsplit(x,"")
#In order to select every third element of this vector I used this function.
a <- 1:121
b <- a[seq(1, length(a), 3)]
b

#Taking out the punctuation
x1 <- gsub("[[:punct:][:blank:]]+","", x)
x1
strsplit(x1,'')
#In order to select every third element, without the punctuation and spaces of this vector, I used the same function as above.
c <- 1:97
#To extract every third element I used
d <- c[seq(1, length(c),3)]
d
#Challenge 2: 
m <- matrix (data=1:80, nrow = 8,ncol = 10,byrow = FALSE)
m
#Extract the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th columns and assign them to the variable x
x<-c(m[2],m[3],m[6])
x
#Extract the 6th to 8th row and assign them to the variable x
x<-c(m[,6],m[,8])
x
#Extract the elements from row 2, column 2 to row 6, column 9 and assign them to the variable x.
x<-c(m[2:6],m[2:9])

#Challenge 3
#Construct a 4-dimensional, 400 element array (5x5x4x4) named a consisting of the numbers 400 to 1 (i.e., a descending series)
a <- array(data = 400:1,dim = c(5,5,4,4))
a
#Given this matrix, what would the following return?
a[1, 1, 1, 2]
#The value 300, which is an element in the table ,1,2 at row1/column1
a[2, 3, 2, ]
#The values: 364, 264, 164, and 64. Which are located in every second table in row 2/column3
a[1:5, 1:5, 3, 3]
#Same values as table ,3,3

#Challenge 4
#Create a list representing a group of primate taxons. 
#First we will need to create a vector for the the lowest taxon rank (Platyrrhini, Catarrhini), and then combine the previous one using the function list under Anthropoidea. Follow the same criterion with the other taxa.

#Challenge 5
#Store the following numbers as a 5x3 matrix: 3,0,1,23,1,2,33,1,1,42,0,1,41,0,2.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
